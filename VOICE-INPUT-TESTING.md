# Voice Input & Manual Event Creation Testing

## Voice Input Testing

### Supported Browsers
- **Chrome**: Full support with Web Speech API
- **Safari**: Limited support (may not work on all versions)
- **Firefox**: Not supported
- **Edge**: Limited support

### Test Voice Commands
Try these voice commands to test the voice input feature:

1. **Simple appointment**: "Bank appointment at 10am on Wednesday"
2. **With location**: "Team meeting at 2pm tomorrow at the office"
3. **All day event**: "Vacation day on Friday"
4. **Complex event**: "Doctor appointment at 3:30pm on Monday at Medical Center"

### Voice Input Features
- Natural language parsing
- Automatic date/time extraction
- Location detection
- Title extraction from speech

## Manual Event Creation

### New Feature: Manual Event Form
We now support manual event creation through a traditional form interface.

### How to Access
1. **Header Button**: Click the green âž• button in the top-right header
2. **Sidebar Button**: Click "Add Event" in the Quick Actions sidebar

### Form Features
- **Event Title**: Required field for event name
- **Date Selection**: Date picker with today as default
- **Time Fields**: Start and end time (hidden for all-day events)
- **All Day Toggle**: Checkbox to mark events as all-day
- **Location**: Optional location field
- **Description**: Optional description field
- **Auto-completion**: End time automatically set to 1 hour after start time

### Form Validation
- Title is required
- Date is required
- Form shows helpful error messages
- Prevents submission with invalid data

### User Experience Improvements
- Default date set to today
- Auto-completion of end time
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Mobile-responsive design
- Form resets after submission

## Testing Both Features

### Voice Input Testing Steps
1. Sign in to the application
2. Click the blue ðŸŽ¤ button (voice input)
3. Allow microphone access when prompted
4. Speak a test command
5. Verify the parsed event data
6. Confirm event creation

### Manual Form Testing Steps
1. Sign in to the application
2. Click the green âž• button (manual form)
3. Fill out the event form
4. Test validation by leaving required fields empty
5. Test all-day event toggle
6. Test auto-completion of end time
7. Submit the form and verify event creation

### Expected Behavior
Both voice input and manual form should:
- Create events in the connected calendar providers
- Show events in the unified calendar view
- Display success notifications
- Handle errors gracefully
- Work on both desktop and mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

### Voice Input Issues
- **No microphone access**: Check browser permissions
- **Not recognizing speech**: Try speaking more clearly
- **Wrong parsing**: Check the transcript display
- **Browser not supported**: Use Chrome for best results

### Manual Form Issues
- **Form not opening**: Check for JavaScript errors
- **Validation errors**: Ensure required fields are filled
- **Date issues**: Verify date format compatibility
- **Time issues**: Check time zone settings

## Development Notes

### Voice Input Component
- Located at: `src/components/VoiceInput.tsx`
- Uses Web Speech API
- Parses natural language to structured data
- Handles browser compatibility

### Manual Form Component
- Located at: `src/components/EventForm.tsx`
- Traditional form interface
- Form validation and error handling
- Auto-completion features
- Mobile-responsive design

### Integration
Both components:
- Use the same `VoiceEventData` interface
- Call the same `onEventParsed` callback
- Integrate with existing event creation flow
- Work with all connected calendar providers
